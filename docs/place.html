        <p> My favorite place to visit is Charleston West Virginia. The resoning is because it where all of my family lives. I barely get to see them maybe once every year or two. But last weekend I got to go to my aunts wedding and it's the first time I saw my family in two years because of Covid. We usually go to college and highschool football games while visiting. Everyone in my family shares one intrest which is football.</p>
