        <h2> boyz n the hood</h2>
        <p>My favorite movie is boyz n the hood. I was first introduced to it through my uncle. Although its an old movie its a really good one. Its been a while since I've watched it but since I started this assignment I might go watch it tonight. I love the story even the unfortunate parts. It was directed really well for a movie of its time.</p>
